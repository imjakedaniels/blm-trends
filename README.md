# #BlackLivesMatter Interactive Web Page

I sampled tweets from the top 50 Twitter Trends every hour using {rtweet} since May 7th. I subset trends that included mentions of #BlackLives Matter, Police, and Racist.

I created an interactive Treemap using D3 through {d3treeR}, and a searchable datatable to highlight dates with lots of topics around these conversations, and the underlying context for each trend.
